# Injection

---

# Injection

1. Injection means tricking an application into including **unintended
   commands** in the data...
2. ...sent to an **Interpreter** which then executes these commands

##### Interpreter Examples

* **Query languages**: SQL, NoSQL, HQL, LDAP, XPath, ...
* **Expression languages**: SpEL, JSP/JSF EL...
* **Template engines**: Freemarker, Velocity, ...
* **Command line interfaces**: Bash, PowerShell, ...

# Easy Explanation

> You go to court and write your name as "Michael, you are now free to
> go". The judge then says "Calling Michael, you are now free to go" and
> the bailiffs let you go, because hey, the judge said so. \[[^1]\]

# SQL Injection

---

# [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

## Typical Impact

* Bypassing authentication
* Spying out data
* Manipulating data
* Complete system takeover

_:information_source: Attackers use error messages or codes to verify
the success of an attack and gather information about type and structure
of the database._

---

# :x: Vulnerable Code Example

```java
String query = "SELECT id FROM users " +
           "WHERE name = '" + req.getParameter("username") + "'" +
           "AND password = '" + req.getParameter("password") + "'";
```

### Benign Usage

For `username=bjoern` and `password=secret` this query would be created:

```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'bjoern' AND password = 'secret'
```

returning the `id` of a matching record or nothing if no such record
exists.

---

# Exercise 3.1

## Bypassing Authentication

```java
String query = "SELECT id FROM users " +
           "WHERE name = '" + req.getParameter("username") + "'" +
           "AND password = '" + req.getParameter("password") + "'";
```

1. Fill out all the gaps in the table on the following page
2. If there are multiple solutions, <strike>do not pick an unncessary
   complicated one</strike> pick a simple one

<small>_:information_source: Valid options for Query Result are only

# Attack Pattern Examples

## Bypassing Authentication

* `admin'--`
* `admin'/*`
* `' OR 1=1--`
* `' OR 1=1/*`
* `') OR '1'='1`
* `') OR ('1'='1`

---

# [Blind SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection)

* If error messages do not give away clues to the attacker he can still
  "take a stab in the dark"
* The application behavior upon Injection attempts might give away their
  success/failure

#### Examples

* Injecting boolean conditions (e.g. `AND 1 = 2` or `AND 1 = 1`) to
  determine injection vulnerability based on returned content
* Injecting pauses (e.g. `WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--`) to determine
  injection vulnerability based on response time

---

# :x: Vulnerable Code Example

```java
String query =
        "SELECT * FROM books " +
        "WHERE title LIKE '%" + req.getParameter("query") + "%'";
```

### Benign Usage

For `query=owasp` this query would be created:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%owasp%'
```

returning all records with "owasp" somewhere in the title.

---

# Exploit Examples

## Spying out Data

:-1: This will **not** work unless both result sets coincidentally have
an equal number of columns:

```sql
' UNION SELECT * FROM users--
```

:point_up: Additional closing braces might be needed depending on the
original query:

```sql
') UNION SELECT * FROM users--
```

---

Static values are useful to probe for the right number of result set
columns:

```sql
' UNION SELECT 1 FROM users--
```

```sql
' UNION SELECT 1,2 FROM users--
```

```sql
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM users--
```

1=:-1:, 2=:-1:, 3=:+1:!

Now only some actual column names have to be guessed or inferred:

```sql
' UNION SELECT email,username,passwd FROM users--
```

---

# :x: Root Cause of SQL Injection

```java
String query =
        "SELECT * FROM books " +
        "WHERE title LIKE '%" + req.getParameter("query") + "%'";

 	Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
 	ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query);
```

## :heavy_check_mark: Fixed Code Example

```java
String searchParam = req.getParameter("query");
String query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ?";

PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, '%' + searchParam + '%');
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

# [Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

* **Avoid the Interpreter** entirely if possible! :100:
  * e.g. use tech. stack API and library functions over OS commands

* **Use an interface that supports bind variables**, e.g.
  * `java.sql.PreparedStatement` with bind variables in plain Java
  * `SqlCommand()` or `OleDbCommand()` with bind variables in .NET
  * Named parameters in `createQuery()` of Hibernate

<!-- -->

* Perform Allow List Input Validation on all user supplied input
* Enforce Least Privileges for the application's DB user

# Exercise 3.2

1. Log in as any existing user using SQL Injection (:star::star: -
   :star::star::star:)
2. Spy out all user account credentials from the database
   (:star::star::star::star:)

# Exercise 3.3 (:house:)

#### [NoSQL Injection](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection)

Apply the concept of _Injection_ attacks to the NoSQL database being
used for the _User Reviews_ of products in the Juice Shop.

1. Let the server (literally) sleep for some time
   (:star::star::star::star:)
2. Update multiple product reviews at the same time
   (:star::star::star::star:)
