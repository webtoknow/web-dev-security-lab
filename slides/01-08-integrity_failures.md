# Software & Data Integrity Failures

# Software & Data Integrity Failures

* Code and infrastructure not protected against integrity violations, e.g.
  * application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content
  delivery networks (CDNs)
  * insecure CI/CD pipeline introduces the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise
  * auto-update functionality downloading and applying updates without sufficient integrity verification
* Objects or data encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, e.g. insecure native serialization formats and libraries being used

# [Prevention](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/#how-to-prevent)

- **Using digital signatures** to verify the software or data is unaltered and from the expected source
- Ensuring libraries and dependencies (e.g. `npm` or Maven) **consume trusted repositories**
- Hosting an internal known-good and vetted repository as a proxy
- Using a software supply chain security tool (e.g. [OWASP Dependency Check](01-07-insecure_dependencies_and_configuration.md#owaspdependency-checkhttpsjeremylonggithubiodependencycheck) or OWASP CycloneDX) to verify that components do not contain known vulnerabilities

---
 
- Establishing a review process for code and configuration changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into the software pipeline
- Establishing a CI/CD pipeline with proper segregation, configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing through the build and deploy processes

# Deserialization

# Serialization

> Object serialization transforms an object's data to a bytestream that
> represents the state of the data. The serialized form of the data
> contains enough information to recreate the object with its data in a
> similar state to what it was when saved. \[[^1]\]

# Deserialization

```java
InputStream is = request.getInputStream();
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(is);
AcmeObject acme = (AcmeObject)ois.readObject();
```

* The casting operation to `AcmeObject` occurs **after** the
  deserialization process ends
* It is not useful in preventing any attacks that happen during
  deserialization from occurring

---

# [Insecure Deserialization](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data)

* Insecure deserialization often leads to **remote code execution**
  (RCE), one of the most serious attacks possible
* Other possible attacks include
  * replay attacks
  * injection attacks
  * privilege escalation
  * DoS

# Exercise 8.2

1. What happens when the `root` object would be deserialized?

```java
ArrayList<Object> root = new ArrayList<>(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```

---

# Exercise 8.3

1. What happens when the `root` object would be deserialized?

```java
Set root = new HashSet();
Set s1 = root;
Set s2 = new HashSet();
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  Set t1 = new HashSet();
  Set t2 = new HashSet();
  t1.add("foo");
  s1.add(t1);
  s1.add(t2);
  s2.add(t1);
  s2.add(t2);
  s1 = t1;
  s2 = t2;
}
```

---

# [Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)

* **Avoid native deserialization formats** :100:
  * JSON/XML lessens (but not removes) the chance of custom
    deserialization logic being maliciously repurposed
* Use the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern
  * Exclusive purpose is data transfer between application layers

---

##### If serialization cannot be avoided

* Sign any serialized objects & only deserialize signed data
* Enforce strict type constraints during deserialization before object
  creation (Not sufficient on its own!)
* Isolate deserialization in low privilege environments
* Log deserialization exceptions and failures
* Restrict or monitor incoming and outgoing network connectivity from
  containers or servers that deserialize
* Monitor & alert if a user deserializes constantly

# :heavy_check_mark: [SerialKiller (Java)](https://github.com/ikkisoft/SerialKiller)

Replacing every `java.io.ObjectInputStream` instanciation

```
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(is);
String msg = (String) ois.readObject();
```

with `SerialKiller` from a look-ahead Java deserialization library

```
ObjectInputStream ois = new SerialKiller(is, "/etc/serialkiller.conf");
String msg = (String) ois.readObject();
```

secures the application from untrusted input. Via `serialkiller.conf`
classes can be block- or allowlisted.

# :x: [node-serialize (JavaScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-serialize)

The `node-serialize` module uses `eval()` internally for
deserialization, allowing exploits like

```javascript
var serialize = require('node-serialize');                                                               
var x = '{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){console.log(\'exploited\')}()"}'
serialize.unserialize(x);
```

_:warning: The affected version `0.0.4` of `node-serialize` is also the
latest version of this module!_

# Exercise 8.4 (:house:)

1. Report at least one of two [typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting) dependencies that the Juice Shop fell for (:star::star::star::star: - :star::star::star::star::star:)
2. Report another vulnerability that could be exploited in a
   [Software Supply Chain Attack](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management/documents/ssca/2017-winter/NCSC_Placemat.pdf)
   (:star::star::star::star::star:)

---

# Exercise 8.5 (:house:)

1. Find the „NextGen“ successor to the half-heartedly deprecated
   XML-based B2B API
   * This new API uses a popular standard for REST API specification &
     documentation
2. Exploit this API with at least one successful DoS-like Remote Code
   Exeution (:star::star::star::star::star: -
   :star::star::star::star::star::star:)

_:information_source: If the server would need >2sec to process your
attack request, it is considered „DoS-like“ enough._
