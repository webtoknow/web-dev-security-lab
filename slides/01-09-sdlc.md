# Secure Development Lifecycle

:x: Identifying errors in late lifecycle phases makes them more
expensive to fix or mitigate. \[[^1]\]

:x: Having an unpublished or informal Secure Development Lifecycle will
not be successful. \[[^2]\]

:heavy_check_mark: Security must be embedded into all stages of the
Software Development Lifecycle to be effective. \[[^2]\]

:heavy_check_mark: A close connection with the right expert and
management drive from the beginning are both mandatory. \[[^3]\]

# Spaghetti Analogy

Sprinkling security on insecurely written software is equivalent to
sprinkling salt on spaghetti :spaghetti: after cooking them in unsalted

# Security Requirements

---

#### [Derive Security Requirements from Business Functionality](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Requirements_-_1)

* Gather and review functional requirements
* For each functional requirement derive relevant security requirements
  * Lead stakeholders through explicitly noting security expectations
    * e.g. data security, access control, transaction integrity,
      criticality of business function, separation of duties, uptime
      etc.
  * Follow the same principles for writing good requirements in general
    * i.e. they should be specific, measurable, and reasonable

---

#### [Security and Compliance Guidance for Requirements](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Requirements_-_1)

* Determine industry best-practices that project teams should treat as
  requirements
  * e.g. publicly available guidelines, internal or external
    guidelines/standards/policies, or established compliance
    requirements
* Do not attempt to bring in too many best-practice requirements into
  each development iteration
* Slowly add best-practices over successive development cycles

# Secure Design Principles

# [Secure Design Principles](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles)

|                               |                               |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| Minimize Attack Surface Area  | Don't trust Services          |
| Establish Secure Defaults     | Separation of Duties          |
| Principle of Least Privilege  | Avoid Security by Obscurity   |
| Principle of Defense in Depth | Keep Security simple          |
| Fail securely                 | Fix Security Issues correctly |

---

## Minimize Attack Surface Area

* **Every feature** that is added to an application **adds a certain
  amount of risk** to the overall application
* The aim for secure development is to **reduce** the overall risk by
  reducing **the attack surface area**

---

## Establish Secure Defaults

* The **"out-of-box"** experience for the user **should be secure**
* It should be up to the user to reduce their security - if they are
  allowed

---

## Principle of Least Privilege

* Accounts have the **least amount of privilege required** to perform
  their business processes
* This encompasses user rights and resource permissions, e.g.
  * CPU limits
  * memory
  * network
  * file system

---

## Principle of Defense in Depth

* Where one control would be reasonable, **more controls that approach
  risks in different fashions** are better
* In-depth-controls can make severe vulnerabilities extraordinarily
  difficult to exploit

---

## Fail securely

* Whenever a transaction fails or code execution throws an exception it
  should **always "fail closed"** and never "fail open"

---

## Don't trust Services

* Third party partners more than likely have differing security policies
  and posture
* Implicit **trust of externally run systems is not warranted**
* All external systems should be treated in a similar fashion

---

## Separation of Duties

* Separation of duties is a key **fraud control**
* **Administrators should not also be users** of an application they are
  responsible for

---

## Avoid Security by Obscurity

* Security through obscurity is a weak security control, and nearly
  always fails when it is the only control
* The **security** of key systems **should not be reliant upon keeping
  details hidden**

---

## Keep Security simple

* **Attack surface and simplicity go hand in hand**
* Prefer straightforward and simple code over complex and
  over-engineered approaches
* Avoid the use of double negatives and complex architectures when a
  simpler approach would be faster and simpler

---

## Fix Security Issues correctly

* Once a security issue has been identified, it is important to develop
  a test for it, and to **understand the root cause** of the issue
* It is likely that the security issue is widespread amongst all code
  bases, so **developing the right fix without introducing regressions**
  is essential

# Security Testing

---

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

> Static application security testing (SAST) is a set of technologies
> designed to analyze application source code, byte code and binaries
> for coding and design conditions that are indicative of security
> vulnerabilities. SAST solutions analyze an application from the
> "inside out" in a nonrunning state. \[[^6]\]

[^6]: https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/static-application-security-testing-sast

---

# :muscle: [Strengths of SAST](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

* Scales well - can be run on lots of software, and can be run
  repeatedly (as with nightly builds or continuous integration)
* Useful for things that such tools can automatically find with high
  confidence, such as buffer overflows, SQL Injection Flaws, and so
  forth
* Output is good for developers - highlights the precise source files,
  line numbers, and even subsections of lines that are affected

---

# :-1: [Weaknesses of SAST](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

* Many types of security vulnerabilities are very difficult to find
  automatically (<small>e.g. authentication problems, access control
  issues, insecure use of cryptography, etc.</small>)
* Cover only a relatively small percentage of application security flaws
* High numbers of false positives
* Cannot find configuration issues not represented in the code
* Difficult to _prove_ that an identified security issue is an actual
  vulnerability

# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

# Security Logging & Monitoring

---

# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

* Exploitation of **insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock
  of nearly every major incident**
* **Attackers** rely on the lack of monitoring and timely response to
  **achieve their goals without being detected**
  * Most successful attacks start with vulnerability probing
  * Allowing such probes to continue can raise the likelihood of
    successful exploit to nearly 100%

---

# Examples of Insufficiencies

* <small>Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value
  transactions are not logged</small>
* <small>Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log
  messages</small>
* <small>Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious
  activity</small>
* <small>Logs are only stored locally</small>
* <small>Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation
  processes are not in place or effective</small>
* <small>Penetration testing and scans by automated tools do not trigger
  alerts</small>
* <small>The application is unable to detect, escalate, or alert for
  active attacks in real time or near real time</small>

# Prevention

* Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input
  validation **failures can be**
  * **logged with sufficient user context** to identify suspicious or
    malicious accounts
  * **held for sufficient time** to allow delayed forensic analysis
* Ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed
  by a **centralized log management solution**
  * e.g. [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) (Kibana,
    Elasticsearch, Logstash & Beats)

---

* Ensure **high-value transactions have an audit trail** with integrity
  controls to prevent tampering or deletion
  * e.g. append-only database tables or similar
* Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that **suspicious
  activities are detected** and responded to **in a timely fashion**
* Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan

# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

---

# Web Application Firewall

> A web application firewall (WAF) is an application firewall for HTTP
> applications. It applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation.
> Generally, these rules cover common attacks such as cross-site
> scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
>
> While proxies generally protect clients, WAFs protect servers. A WAF
> is deployed to protect a specific web application or set of web
> applications. A WAF can be considered a reverse proxy. WAFs may come
> in the form of an appliance, server plugin, or filter, and may be
> customized to an application. The effort to perform this customization
> can be significant and needs to be maintained as the application is
> modified. \[[^8]\]

# WAF Deployment in the Network

![Simple Web Application Firewall Architecture](images/01-09-sdlc/WAF_Archi.png)

<small>:bulb: _An application should be able to protect itself! Use a
WAF only as a secondary defense mechanism to achieve
[Defense in Depth](#principle-of-defense-in-depth)! For legacy systems
(with no feasible way to patch directly) a WAF can be the main
protection mechanism._</small>

---

## [Risk in the use of WAFs](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php?title=Category:OWASP_Best_Practices:_Use_of_Web_Application_Firewalls)

* "Yet-another-proxy" (increased complexity of the IT infrastructure)
* Organisational tasks
* Training the WAF on each new release of the web application
* Testing
* False positives (which may have a significant business impact)
* More complex troubleshooting
* WAFs also have/generate errors
* Responsibility for system-wide error situations
* Cost-effectiveness

---

# WAF Modes

* **Blocking Mode**: Normal operational mode where the WAF blocks
  requests it identified as malicious.
* **Monitoring Mode**: The WAF logs alerts but does not block the
  corresponding requests.
* **Learning Mode**: The WAF learns from good traffic (e.g. by
  allowlisted IPs) what the normal use cases and input are.

:bulb: _Learning Mode might lead to false positives on new application
releases when the WAF did not learn any traffic for new functionality._

# [AppSec Pipeline](https://owasp.org/www-project-appsec-pipeline/)

* Applies **principles of DevOps and Lean** to application security
* Designed for **iterative improvement** and has the ability to **grow
  in functionality organically** over time
* Provides a **consistent process** for the application security team
  and the constituency (devs, QA, product & senior managers)
* Throughout the process flow each activity has well-defined states
* **Relies heavily on automation** for repeatable tasks

<small>_:information_source: Start with the area of greatest pain and
work on a reusable path for all the AppSec activities that
follow._</small>

# [Security Champions](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Security_Champions_Playbook)

> Security Champions are "active members of a team that may help to make
> decisions about when to engage the Security Team". They act as a core
> element of security assurance process within the product or service,
> and hold the role of the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) within the
> team.

### :crystal_ball: It's all a question of scalability...

Developers will outnumber Security staff in almost every organization.
There is _no way_ to scale this up without either heavy automation or
offloading security responsibility to the development teams!
