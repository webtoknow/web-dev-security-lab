# [OWASP Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/)

> OWASP Projects are a collection of related tasks that have a defined roadmap and team members. Our projects are open source and are built by our community of volunteers - people just like you! OWASP project leaders are responsible for defining the vision, roadmap, and tasks for the project. The project leader also promotes the project and builds the team. OWASP currently has over 100 active projects, and new project applications are submitted every week.

# [Methodology](https://owasp.org/Top10/#methodology)

> This installment of the Top 10 is more data-driven than ever but not blindly data-driven. We selected eight of the ten categories from contributed data and two categories from the Top 10 community survey at a high level. We do this for a fundamental reason, looking at the contributed data is looking into the past. AppSec researchers take time to find new vulnerabilities and new ways to test for them. It takes time to integrate these tests into tools and processes. By the time we can reliably test a weakness at scale, years have likely passed. To balance that view, we use an community survey to ask application security and development experts on the front lines what they see as essential weaknesses that the data may not show yet.

---

# [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) vs. [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/)

**CWE** = **C**ommon **W**eakness **E**numeration

> **CWE™** is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.

**CVE** = **C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures

> The mission of the **CVE®** Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

> * CWEs Mapped: The number of CWEs mapped to a category by the Top 10 team.
> * Incidence Rate: Incidence rate is the percentage of applications vulnerable to that CWE from the population tested by that org for that year.

> * Weighted Exploit: The Exploit sub-score from CVSSv2 and CVSSv3 scores assigned to CVEs mapped to CWEs, normalized, and placed on a 10pt scale.
> * Weighted Impact: The Impact sub-score from CVSSv2 and CVSSv3 scores assigned to CVEs mapped to CWEs, normalized, and placed on a 10pt scale.
> * (Testing) Coverage: The percentage of applications tested by all organizations for a given CWE.
> * Total Occurrences: Total number of applications found to have the CWEs mapped to a category.

# [Awareness Document vs. Standard](https://owasp.org/Top10/A00_2021_How_to_use_the_OWASP_Top_10_as_a_standard/)

> The OWASP Top 10 is primarily an awareness document. However, this has not stopped organizations using it as a de facto industry AppSec standard since its inception in 2003. If you want to use the OWASP Top 10 as a coding or testing standard, know that it is the bare minimum and just a starting point.
>
> One of the difficulties of using the OWASP Top 10 as a standard is that we document appsec risks, and not necessarily easily testable issues.

> Tools cannot comprehensively detect, test, or protect against the OWASP Top 10 due to the nature of several of the OWASP Top 10 risks, with reference to A04:2021-Insecure Design. OWASP discourages any claims of full coverage of the OWASP Top 10, because it’s simply untrue.
