# Protection needs of data

> The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit
> and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health
> records, personal information, and business secrets require extra
> protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's
> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g.,
> financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). \[[^1]\]

# [Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures)

- **Clear text data transmission** (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, FTP) 
- **Using old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols**
- **Using default crypto keys or generate/re-use weak ones**
- Lack of proper key management or rotation
- Crypto keys are checked into source code repositories
- No enforcement of encryption, e.g. missing security directives or headers

_:information_source: External internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g.,
between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems._

---

- Insufficient certificate and trust chain validation
- Ignoring, reusing or generating insecure initialization vectors for the cryptographic mode of operation
- Using an insecure mode of operation such as ECB
- Not using authenticated encryption when appropriate
- Use passwords as cryptographic keys in absence of a password base key derivation function
- Using insecure randomness functions or seed them weakly
- Using deprecated (e.g. MD5 or SHA1) or [non-cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions#Non-cryptographic_hash_functions) or deprecated cryptographic padding methods (e.g. PKCS number 1 v1.5)  
- Allow cryptographic error messages or side channel information to become
    exploitable, for example in the form of padding oracle attacks

# [Prevention](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/#how-to-prevent)

- **Classifying data** processed, stored, or transmitted by an application
- **Identify sensitive data** according to privacy laws,
    regulatory requirements, or business needs
- **Not storing sensitive data unnecessarily and discarding it as soon as possible** :100:
- **Encrypting all sensitive data** at rest
- Ensuring up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and
    keys are in place while using proper key management

---

- **Encrypting all data in transit** with secure protocols (e.g. TLS with
    [forward secrecy (FS)](#perfectforwardsecrecypfshttpswwwwiredcom201611what-is-perfect-forward-secrecy) ciphers), cipher prioritization by the
    server, and secure parameters
- Enforcing encryption with directives
    like [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](#httpstricttransportsecurityhstshttpscheatsheetseriesowasporgcheatsheetshttp_strict_transport_security_cheat_sheethtml)
- No caching of responses that contain sensitive data
- Applying required security controls as per the data classification
- Not using legacy protocols (e.g. FTP and SMTP) for transporting
    sensitive data
- Storing passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions
    with a work factor (delay factor)
- Verifying independently the effectiveness of configuration and
    settings

## [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)

> HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an opt-in security
> enhancement that is specified by a web application through the use of
> a special response header. Once a supported browser receives this
> header that browser will prevent any communications from being sent
> over HTTP to the specified domain and will instead send all
> communications over HTTPS. It also prevents HTTPS click through
> prompts on browsers.

##### Example

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=16070400; includeSubDomains
```

## [Secure Cryptographic Storage Design](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

* Only store sensitive data that you need
* Use strong approved Authenticated Encryption
* Store a one-way and salted value of passwords
* Ensure that the cryptographic protection remains secure even if access
  controls fail
* Ensure that any secret key is protected from unauthorized access
* Follow applicable regulations on use of cryptography

---

## [Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/what-is-perfect-forward-secrecy/)

> Perfect forward secrecy means that a piece of an encryption system
> automatically and frequently changes the keys it uses to encrypt and
> decrypt information, such that if the latest key is compromised, it
> exposes only a small portion of the user’s sensitive data. Encryption
> tools with perfect forward secrecy switch their keys as frequently as
> every message in text-based conversation, every phone call in the case
> of encrypted calling apps, or every time a user loads or reloads an
> encrypted web page in his or her browser.

:information_source: Examples of crypto protocols (used for instant
messaging conversations) providing PFS are
[OTR (Off-the-record) Messaging](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/index.php)
and
[Double Ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/)
(used within [Signal](https://signal.org/)).
